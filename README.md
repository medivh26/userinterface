# User Interface Specification: User Management Screen

## Requirements
- The user management screen should allow administrators to manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, updating existing accounts, and deleting accounts.
- The screen should provide a clear and intuitive interface for performing these user management tasks.

## UI Components
1. **User List**: A table or list displaying the existing user accounts, including their usernames, roles, and status.
2. **Search Bar**: A search bar to allow administrators to search for specific users by username or other relevant criteria.
3. **Create User Form**: A form with input fields for creating a new user account, including username, password, role, and status.
4. **Update User Form**: A form with input fields for updating an existing user account, including the ability to change the username, password, role, and status.
5. **Delete User Button**: A button or action to delete a user account.

## Page Behavior
- **Initial Display**: Upon loading the user management screen, the user list should be displayed, showing all existing user accounts.
- **Creating a User**: When the administrator fills out the create user form and submits the information, a new user account should be added to the user list.
- **Updating a User**: When the administrator selects a user from the user list and updates the user information in the update user form, the changes should be reflected in the user list.
- **Deleting a User**: When the administrator selects a user from the user list and clicks the delete user button, the user account should be removed from the user list.

## User Feedback
- **Success Messages**: Upon successful creation, update, or deletion of a user account, a success message should be displayed to confirm the action.
- **Error Handling**: If there are any errors during user account management (e.g., duplicate username, incomplete form), appropriate error messages should be displayed to guide the administrator.

## Visual Design
- The user management screen should follow the overall design and style of the application, maintaining consistency in color scheme, typography, and layout.
- Use clear and intuitive form designs, buttons, and visual cues to guide administrators through the user management process.

## Accessibility
- Ensure that all UI components and actions are accessible to users with disabilities, following accessibility guidelines and best practices.

By following these specifications, the user management screen can provide a seamless and efficient experience for administrators to manage user accounts within the application.
